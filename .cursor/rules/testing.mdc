Always validate mock data in tests against actual API response structures
Consider adding integration tests with real API endpoints for critical data flows
Document expected API response formats in comments or separate interface files
Test components with edge cases and various data structures, not just the happy path

When an issue is found in production that wasn't caught by tests, add a specific test for that scenario
