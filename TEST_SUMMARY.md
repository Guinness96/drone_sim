# Test Summary for Project Runner Module Refactoring

## Overview

The project runner module (`project_runner`) was refactored from a monolithic script (`run.py`) into a modular Python package with separate components for handling different aspects of project startup. This summary documents the testing approach and results.

## Module Structure

The project runner module was split into the following components:

- `project_runner/postgres.py`: PostgreSQL database management
- `project_runner/servers.py`: Backend and frontend server management
- `project_runner/process.py`: Process monitoring and cleanup
- `project_runner/cli.py`: Command-line interface and main entry point

## Testing Approach

A comprehensive testing strategy was implemented to ensure the refactored code functions correctly:

1. Unit tests for each component, verifying:
   - Process monitoring and termination
   - PostgreSQL database startup and status checking
   - Server management and error handling
   - CLI argument parsing and command execution

2. Integration tests ensuring:
   - Proper interaction between components
   - Correct startup and shutdown sequences
   - Error recovery and graceful degradation

## Test Framework Standardisation

As part of improving test maintainability, all tests have been standardised to use pytest instead of unittest:

1. Converted test files:
   - `tests/project_runner/test_process.py`
   - `tests/project_runner/test_postgres.py`
   - `tests/project_runner/test_servers.py`
   - `tests/project_runner/test_cli.py`
   - `tests/test_postgres_integration.py`
   - `tests/test_run.py`

2. Files already using pytest style:
   - `simulation/tests/test_simulator.py`
   - `backend/tests/test_models.py`
   - `backend/tests/test_api.py`

### Benefits of pytest standardisation:

- **Improved readability**: Function-based tests are more concise and readable than class-based tests
- **Better fixture management**: pytest fixtures provide more flexible test setup and teardown
- **Built-in assertions**: Simple assert statements with automatic introspection upon failure
- **Parameterised testing**: Easier to test multiple variations of the same functionality
- **Less boilerplate code**: Reduced code duplication and simpler test structure
- **Better error reporting**: More informative error messages when tests fail

## Test Coverage

The tests cover the following key functionality:

- **postgres.py**:
  - ✅ Starting PostgreSQL server
  - ✅ Checking PostgreSQL server status
  - ✅ Handling PostgreSQL server errors
  - ✅ Integration with system PostgreSQL installation

- **servers.py**:
  - ✅ Starting backend server
  - ✅ Starting frontend development server
  - ✅ Handling port conflicts
  - ✅ Detecting server startup failures
  - ✅ Proper server process management

- **process.py**:
  - ✅ Process creation and monitoring
  - ✅ Clean termination of processes
  - ✅ Forced termination when necessary
  - ✅ Signal handling

- **cli.py**:
  - ✅ Command-line argument parsing
  - ✅ Executing appropriate commands based on arguments
  - ✅ Proper error handling and reporting
  - ✅ Signal handling for clean shutdown

## Recommendations for Future Test Improvements

1. **Add test coverage reporting**: Implement pytest-cov to quantify test coverage
2. **Expand edge case tests**: Add tests for uncommon but possible error conditions
3. **Parameterise more tests**: Identify tests that could benefit from parametrisation
4. **Add markers for test categorisation**: Use pytest markers to organise tests
5. **Create test documentation**: Document test fixtures and patterns for future reference

## Conclusion

The refactoring of the project runner module has been thoroughly tested, with all tests now using the pytest framework for improved consistency and maintainability. The codebase now has a strong foundation of tests that can be extended as new features are added.
